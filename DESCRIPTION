Description: Provides tools to easily access and analyze Canadian Election Study data.
    The package simplifies the process of downloading, cleaning, and using 'CES' datasets
    for political science research and analysis. The Canadian Election Study ('CES')
    has been conducted during federal elections since 1965, surveying Canadians
    on their political preferences, engagement, and demographics. Data is accessed
    from the 'Borealis' Data repository <https://borealisdata.ca/>, which serves as 
    the official host for 'CES' datasets. This package is not officially affiliated 
    with the Canadian Election Study or 'Borealis' Data, and users should cite the 
    original data sources in their work.
