Description: Provides tools to easily access and analyze Canadian Election Study data.
    The package simplifies the process of downloading, cleaning, and using 'CES' datasets
    for political science research and analysis. The Canadian Election Study ('CES')
    has been conducted during federal elections since 1965, surveying Canadians
    on their political preferences, engagement, and demographics. Data is accessed
    from multiple sources including the 'Borealis' Data repository 
    <https://borealisdata.ca/> and the official 'Canadian Election Study' website 
    <https://ces-eec.arts.ubc.ca/>. This package is not officially affiliated 
    with the Canadian Election Study, 'Borealis' Data, or the University of British 
    Columbia, and users should cite the original data sources in their work.
