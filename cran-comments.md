## Resubmission Note (v1.0.1)

This is a rapid resubmission to correct a critical bug discovered shortly after the submission of v1.0.0. The original submission comments for the v1.0.0 major release are preserved below.

The bug prevented `get_ces("2015", variant = "combo")` from working due to incorrect file format metadata. This has been corrected. No other changes have been made.
