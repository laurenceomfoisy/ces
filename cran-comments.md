## Changes from Previous Submission

The following issues from the previous CRAN review have been addressed:

1. **Replaced \dontrun{} with \donttest{}**: All examples that download data now use \donttest{} instead of \dontrun{} as they can be executed but are time-consuming.

2. **Fixed file writing behavior**: Functions no longer write to user's home filespace by default. Instead, they:
   - Use Downloads directory if available, otherwise tempdir()
   - All examples use tempdir() explicitly
   - Documentation clearly states the new default behavior

3. **Removed installation script**: Removed inst/scripts/install.R which violated CRAN policy by installing packages.

## Package purpose

This package provides tools for accessing and analyzing Canadian Election Study (CES) datasets. The CES has been conducted during federal elections since 1965, providing valuable data for political science research.

The package handles downloading data files from the Borealis Data repository, converts them to appropriate R formats, and provides utilities for subsetting and analyzing the data.

## URL Stability and Network Access

* All data is hosted at Borealis Data repository, a stable institutional repository for Canadian research data
* All functions that require internet access use appropriate error handling
* All examples requiring network access are properly wrapped in \donttest{}
* The package includes caching mechanisms to reduce unnecessary downloads
